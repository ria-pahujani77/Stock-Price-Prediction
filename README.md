# Asian Paints Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a stock price prediction model for Asian Paints using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The prediction model is built using TensorFlow and trained on historical stock price data.
The project is in the other brach - master.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip install`):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - tensorflow

## Usage

1. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Contents
- stock_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook script for predicting stock prices.
- AsianPaints.csv: Example CSV file containing historical Asian Paints stock data.

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. Predicting stock prices is inherently uncertain, and the model's predictions may not be accurate. Use the code and predictions at your own risk.
